# Student's or T-Distribution
In probability and statistics, Student's t-distribution (or simply the t-distribution) is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is **small** and population standard deviation is **unknown**.

### Formula

- Degrees of Freedom: \\\(df = n - 1\\\)
- Standard Deviation: \\\(\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_1 - x_2)^2}}{n-1}}\\\)
- Standard Error: \\\(sem = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\\\)
- T-score: \\\(t = \frac{\bar{x}- M}{sem}\\\)
- Cohen's d: \\\(cd = \frac {{\bar{x}  -  M}} {\sigma}\\\)
- r2: \\\(r^2 = \frac{t^2}{t^2 + df}\\\)
- Margin of Error: \\\(moe = \text{t-critical} \times sem\\\)
- Confidence interval: \\\(ci = \bar{x} \pm moe\\\)
